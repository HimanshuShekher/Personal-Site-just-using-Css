        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p> Learning new Technology has been my passion since when I was little kid. I still remember when I used to get fascinated with computer and mobile games and as I went through the BASIC tutorial, it was almost magic, being able to get the computer to do whatever I wanted. When I was 13 years old I made my first android game SUPER MARIO. I learned C, then C++,  through any books I could find on anything remotely related to software development. I was insatiable.
         <br>

        <p> This passion fascinated me to pursue my Btech Engineering .

            CURRENTLY A B.Tech  UNDERGRADUATE, looking for Internships and Full-Time opportunities in the IT sector as an  Software Engineer. </p>

              <br>
      <p> ✔ Life long devotee of  technology's and enhancing the knowledge each and every day.<p>
        <br>
           <p>✔ I enjoy challenges that enable me to grow. I like to find application in what is taught to me and use Feynman and Pomodoro techniques to learn as quickly as possible.</p>
